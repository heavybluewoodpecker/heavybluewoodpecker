Hello I am Mr.G,or heavybluewoodpecker.
So I have been taking some computer classes, trying to learn all I can.
If your wandering I believe I read somewhere that a typical Blue woodpecker, on
average is only about 1 inch tall. Imagine being related to dino's and only an inch
tall.
I recently rooted my 2021 Moto Stylus with Magisk. Ive actully had a lot of fun
working on this project, learned a lot too.
So I thought I would share that with everyone.
Its been a great build, still a great devise. Enjoy
                                 Mr.G
