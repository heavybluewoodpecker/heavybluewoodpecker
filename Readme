###Denver-Global###
## 2021 Motorola Stylus G 5g (XT-2131-1) rooted with Magisk

Queston? What is rooted and why? So basically rooting a device means:
All features unlocked except sim, and user has control of all the settings.
It means I am completely responsible for my device and its condition.
That being said, I have to say. This Repository only refers to Named Device, in 
Repo = 2021 Motorola Stylus G 5g (XT-2131-1 Denver-Global)

### Preinstallation
Since this repo is explicit to this device. I'm going to lay it down like I picked
it up.

A: TeamWin-TWRP 
   http://twrp.me, I had to check the device tree, to see if there was even a
   recovery I could use. At first no, but I didnt give up, and found this ->
   Make sure you have the right files from Twrp, dont brick your device

#### Installation
   If I did all the prep right this will go quick
   
 1: Connect my device to my PC via USB cable, head on into Developer Settings
    Turn on debugging mode, when file transfer pops up on the screen of your 
    device click on it(accept)
    
 2: G0 to your terminal on your PC run: adb devices, it will say something about
    starting your server, then your device name.
    
 3: Now you type adb reboot fastboot, your device will reboot to fastboot mode
 
 4: Type fastboot devices, make sure your in fastboot mode
 
 5: you got two files from TWRP, you need the one that says twrp.xxx.img.
    I always rename it to boot.img
    
 6: Go to your command fastboot boot.img (<-actual boot.img) do not flash it
    just boot. After you boot into TWRP recovery you can flash in the twrp.
    top left of the menu is the install heading. Go and locate your 
    Magisk Manager and flash it. After that reboot back into you sysem.
